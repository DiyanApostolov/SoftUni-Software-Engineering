The  **“C# Advanced”** course extends the previously gained fundamental coding skills from the **“Programming Fundamentals”** course at the Software University and adds additional knowledge and practical programming skills. This course builds on the skills of working with the C# language and the .NET platform, showing more complex concepts typical of the language. The course teaches the creation of a linear data structure, solving algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), working with streams, files and directories, creating template classes. Attention is paid to the paradigm for functional programming, as well as to the main tool for its replacement - LINQ for data flow processing.
