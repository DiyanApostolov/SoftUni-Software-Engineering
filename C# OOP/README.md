The "C # OOP" course will look at the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) to work with classes and objects, use proper-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied. The most commonly used design templates (creative, structural and behavioral design patterns) will be considered. We will get acquainted with SOLID principles for directly oriented software design. Different debugging techniques and how to create and use decorators (decorators) will be discussed. Attention will be paid to component testing (writing single tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
