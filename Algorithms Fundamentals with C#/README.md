The course in algorithms introduces participants to the most common programming techniques. Along with this, many algorithmic problems are solved and an analysis of different approaches is performed - their properties, applications, advantages and disadvantages. You will develop your skills for algorithmic thinking and acquire skills to work with the main classes of algorithms used in practice: recursion and backtracking, recursion using variables, combinatorial algorithms, search, sorting and greedy algorithms, and graph theory - realization in computer memory, crawling and finding the shortest path. You will also gain skills for applying dynamic programming in solving optimization tasks.
